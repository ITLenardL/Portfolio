# Portfolio

Tasked to update and improve old portfolio file, as at the time there were no projects completed so the tiles were simply hypotheticals. Now with completed projects create an actual portfolio.

# Structure:

Downloaded a template from bootstrap to edit my work into, added links and added/removed social buttons, edited links as well as changed styling functions/pictures and information.

# Goals:

Aimed to create a clean actual professional looking portfolio that is easy to read and link. A good base to which I can add on to when my skills further develop.
